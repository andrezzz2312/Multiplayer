![ModIcon](https://github.com/Balatro-Multiplayer/BalatroMultiplayer/blob/2cd9015963c1118e0b849f11e7c335f97b74f36c/assets/2x/modicon.png)

This is a fork of the [Balatro Multiplayer Mod](https://github.com/Balatro-Multiplayer/BalatroMultiplayer).

The main difference is that this fork includes a **custom ruleset where no vanilla jokers are allowed**.  
It is intended for players who want a more experimental or balanced competitive experience without the base game’s standard jokers.
